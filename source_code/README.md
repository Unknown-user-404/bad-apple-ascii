# Requirements
install package in the requirements.txt file(use command: pip install -r requirements.txt)
create a folder called input
if the video maker is not working in main.py try running vid.py
after finishing video you can delete all frames to save up space
(colored video will often take more frames and more space to generate, e.g. Bad apple took me about 10 to 20 min to make and took about 3 GB, rickroll took me about 1 hours and took 10 GB of space, they both have about 6000 frames)
